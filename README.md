# drone_garbage_detector

As the name suggests, this is a drone garbage detecting software that was developed in the aim of reducing the number of garbage on beaches and rivers. Once a a footage of a drone garabage is uploaded, this software will pin and label all the locations of the trash the software is able to detect on a map. In this spirit, people can use this generated map to identify and cleanup trashes on becahes, rivers, or other landscapes.

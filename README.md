## üåç Project Overview: **AI-Based Coastal Trash Detection and Heatmap Visualization**

### üìå **Introduction: drone_garbage_detector** 

This system leverages drone video footage and artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically detect and visualize coastal garbage. It presents the distribution of trash on an interactive heatmap, offering a valuable tool for environmental monitoring and coastal cleanup planning.
As the name suggests, this is a drone garbage detecting software that was developed in the aim of reducing the number of garbage on beaches and rivers. Once a a footage of a drone garabage is uploaded, this software will pin and label all the locations of the trash the software is able to detect on a map. In this spirit, people can use this generated map to identify and cleanup trashes on becahes, rivers, or other landscapes.

### üß≠ **System Workflow**

1. **Drone Filming**

   * A drone captures aerial video footage along the coastline, recording both visual and GPS data.

2. **Data Extraction**

   * The **flight log** is processed to extract GPS location data using [PhantomHelp Log Viewer](https://www.phantomhelp.com/logviewer/).
   * The **video file** is analyzed using an AI model trained to detect beach garbage:

     - examplesÔºöTrash detected by the AI model is highlighted with purple bounding boxes.

3. **Analysis Program**

   * The AI model identifies trash in the video frames and matches them with corresponding GPS coordinates based on timestamps.
   * This generates structured geographic data of trash locations and density.

4. **Heatmap Visualization**

   * Detected garbage locations are plotted on an interactive map using Leaflet and heatmap visualization techniques.
   * Each trash hotspot is represented by color intensity corresponding to trash concentration.
   * The heatmap page can be viewed in a browser for real-time exploration and monitoring.
